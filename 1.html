  <p>We used to be best buddies, but now we're not. I wish you would tell me why.

  <p>I think some comapany is overdue. I've started talking th the pictures on the wall.
  It gets little lonely. All these empty rooms. Just watching the hours tick by.
  Elsa? Pleas I know you're in there. People are asking where you've been. They say 'have courge' and I'm trying to.
  I'm right out here for you, just let me in.
  We only have each other. It's just you and me.
  What are we gonna do? Do you wanna build a snowman.....?
